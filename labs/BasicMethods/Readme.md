## Instructions
1. Add a new console application to your solution - named *BasicMethods*
1. In *Program.cs* add the following method skeletons to the bottom of the file
```C#
double F2C (double f)
{
    return 0;
}
double F2K (double f)
{ 
    return 0; 
}
double C2F (double c)
{
    return 0;
}
double C2K (double c)
{
    return 0;
} 
```
- F2C returns the Celsius temp from a fahrenheit temp
- F2K returns the Kelvin temp from a farenheit temp
- you get the idea...
3. Reference the formulas you created in earlier exercises, complete the methods
3. Add code *above* these methods to call with various sample data and print the converted temps
	- in *top level code files* methods must be below all top level code
5. *Challenge* - use a loop to convert ranges of temperatures using the methods
